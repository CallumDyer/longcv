# longcv

This repository collects Honest CVs from programmers. I want to learn more about how people learn what they learn and examine the sometimes serendipitous or roundabout ways that people come by their skills.

* [tavish's overly honest cv](bio.md)
* [Julia Evans's blog post about her path](http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/02/17/how-i-learned-to-program-in-10-years/)
  * Julia has also shared a repository of her early programs [here](https://github.com/jvns/julias-first-programs)
* [Will Bradley's overly honest CV](https://github.com/tarmstrong/longcv/blob/master/zyphlar-bio.md)
* [Geofrey Ernest's honest CV](https://github.com/tarmstrong/longcv/blob/master/gernest-bio.md)
